Our Voice Intelligence team builds custom speech recognition and natural language processing models to generate insights and real-time recommendations to improve conversations. With AI in Dialpad Sell, we are tackling innovative AI problems such as: ""How can I best position myself against a competitor in a sales pitch?"" ""What kinds of topics resonate with sales prospects, and which don't?"" and ""Which prospects are interested in my product and which should I stop pursuing?"". All with the goal of bringing unprecedented intelligence to your calls.  Who We Are  At Dialpad, we're a team of do-ers. A team that thinks outside the box and when that doesn't work, we reinvent it. We don't settle for the status quo and neither do the things we build. Led by the same minds behind Google Voice, we build products that get businesses talking—whether it's across the hall, street, or country. With $120 million in funding from ICONIQ Capital, Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Scale Ventures and other top VC's Dialpad attracts top engineers from companies like Microsoft and Google, and every member of our team plays an essential role in creating dynamic products that doesn't just combine design and mobility but works with you wherever productivity may strike.  You Will Work Closely With The NLP Team Whose Models Detect Conversational Abstractions Such As Rapport Building Moments, Named Entities, Sentiment, Prospect Interest, Etc To Answer Questions Like  As Data Science &amp; Analytics Manager, you will lead a team of data scientists, BIs and statisticians to turn the outputs of our NLP models into actionable business insights. In particular, your team will find the words and strategies that help sales people close more deals.   what are the customer issues bubbling under the surface -- the things we should flag to product engineering?  can we tell which customers are genuinely interested?  what rate of speaking is too fast?  which buzzwords leave customers confused?   The ideal person has excellent critical thinking skills, observes sound statistical practises, and can work in the gap between business stakeholders and speech/language scientists. The work is a mix of data analysis, database administration, business intelligence &amp; data-driven storytelling. Ideally, you have experience manipulating large data sets and are comfortable operating in an agile environment. You and your team won't need to build NLP machine learning models, but some background is helpful to interface with the NLP team. If you're inspired by innovation and you like working with a smart, talented, generally awesome team, we'd love to hear from you!  Responsibilities    Lead, build and manage a team to turn conversational events from our NLP models into actionable insights for users.   Own and manage the data needed to support customer insights  Ability and desire to deeply understand our users point of view  Ability to work with scientists, linguists and engineers to take interesting questions and turn them into interesting stories told with data  Start with an ad hoc proof-of-concept (what does the data tell us about this question?) then turn it into a process that we can run on a regular basis  Work with marketing to write up our data-driven learnings of what constitutes sales &amp; support best practises to establish thought leadership in our space.   Write and review queries, experimental designs and statistical tests.    Requirements    5+ years of experience in data analysis, business intelligence or similar quantitative role.  2+ years of management experience  Proven history of producing valuable insights for users  Excellent communicator and listener  Drive, imagination and passionate about the problem we are solving  Strong critical thinking skills  Flexible with regards to changing priorities &amp; business needs  Proficient in SQL  Sound statistical skills, ability to review experimental designs and test for significance  Coursework in Mathematics and Statistics    Bonus Points For    Experience with Python (or other scripting language), BigQuery and Google Data Studio is a plus  Expertise or experience in Linguistics, Natural Language Processing or Speech Recognition  Experience with B2B sales and support scenarios  Experience with causal inference frameworks    About Us  Joining our team means collaborating with people that aren't just passionate about their work but about Argentine tango, musicals, sushi burritos, comic books - you name it. Because if you're going to redefine the status quo, you need a group of people hungry to do more, to see more, and be more than where they started.

Ideal for volunteers with an interest in science, getting their feet wet, assisting with a dive centre and spreading the word about shark conservation, and there is also a chance to learn how to get GoPro footage of sharks under the water.  Cage-less snorkeling with upto 5 species of shark  Keywords: Scuba, free diving , shark conservation, SCUBA centre, science, research, education  Participants will become crucial members of our teams as we strive to complete our mission of shark ecotourism, research, conservation and education. The program is jammed with shark activities from conducting ongoing research programs into the health of shark populations on Aliwal Shoal, to assisting and supporting tourists as we introduce them to the underwater world for the first time. The program is located at the world famous Aliwal Shoal , where volunteers will be working with unto five different species of sharks and a host of other marine life. The program is divided into four sections, on which volunteers will work on a daily basis. These include (a) shark research, (b) awareness and outreach, (c) shark and marine conservation and (d) shark ecotourism . The program is designed to cover a broad range of fields, so as to allow volunteers to discover their passion and build towards a career working with sharks and marine life. If students are not SCUBA qualified, then the first week of the program can be used to gain a PADI open water SCUBA certification. SCUBA qualified volunteers can expect between 4 and 8 research SCUBA dives per month.  Blacktip sharks (throughout the year)  This part of the project involves taking part in ocean safaris to snorkel with black-tip sharks as well as taking underwater photographs for identifying the sharks and recording ecological information. The type of information collected include date, GPS location, surface and underwater conditions, size, sex, distinctive features, behaviour of the sharks. The ID photographs help identify each shark and record re-sightings. In addition, volunteers will be an integral part of the ecotourism trips, aiding, photographing and videoing clients during our shark snorkels.  Ragged tooth sharks (May - September)  Our research project is open to SCUBA qualified volunteers (as raggedtooths are a benthic species).

Furthermore, shark behaviour and movements is of particular interest as it relates to tourism and the diving industry in South Africa.  Tiger Shark (February - April)  Tiger shark monitoring involves joining scuba diving and carrying out underwater data collection on this shy species. On occasion film crews will require working with Tiger sharks, and volunteers may be called on to aid in these expeditions.  Humpback Whales (June October)  You may help with monitoring the numbers of humpback whales during their seasonal migration. You will participate in sand dune based observations with binoculars, boat based observations to record the number of whales, observing their behaviour.  General environment (throughout the year)  A more general environmental awareness and clean-up activities include collecting information during field work, collating it in a computer database on-site and online, uploading some data onto an international database where international contributors can access it and use for scientific journals and theses. Your work will also include biodiversity assessments and environmental monitoring. Oceans user surveys are occasionally undertaken.  General Education ( throughout the year )  Participants will assist with our central conservation and awareness campaigns that range from raising awareness to social activism. There are school outreach programs; shark diving-guest education and social media awareness campaigns.  General Crewing ( throughout the year )  Participants will assist with preparing the equipment for the daily ocean outings.They will also be able to learn how to video and photograph guests interacting with the sharks. Most satisfying however is that participants will engage directly with guests, teaching them about sharks and ensuring that the guests are comfortable throughout the activity and leave having learned a great deal about the importance of sharks.

Volunteers not involved in SCUBA training will begin the program activities immediately. Daily life will be centre around early morning sea expeditions. Many of this will be ecotourism trips with clients to snorkel or SCUBA dive with sharks. On these morning trips, volunteers will be allocated roles, including collecting research data, assisting clients, crew assistance, videography or photography. After the morning trips, volunteers will engage with clients on our outreach program to ensure that all guests leave as aware shark ambassadors. Afternoons will be spent entering research data, conducting training classes (e.g. boat maintenance, SCUBA maintenance, briefing training, editing training, etc.) or partaking in further education (school visits) or conservation (beach cleanups, awareness drives) programs. Throughout the month, dedicated days to research, education and conservation programs will also take place.
