A Data Scientist is critical to the success of this program to analyze the data we collect and provide statistical correlations that will drive future business decisions. Our team must provide visibility into the metadata collected from Amazon’s internal systems, software development tools, developer output metrics, and internal surveys to highlight differences across organizations. These variances will help drive discussions and investigations into areas that present potential bottlenecks or risks to software delivery. Based on the learnings from these investigations, we will identify best practices that can be shared with all levels of the organization to drive continuous improvement. A Data Scientist will complete the feedback cycle for our team, synthesizing the data we collect, providing correlation analysis, and guiding future investigations. As a Data Scientist, your role will be to leverage the past data to make future predictions, thereby helping us mitigate the uncertainty of the future by making predictions of future performance. While business intelligence tends to be structured, data science leans more toward the unstructured. You must deal with incomplete, messy, unorganized data, not immediately usable without some degree of cleaning and prepping. You will generate predictive insights and new product innovations by applying advanced analytical tools and algorithms utilizing advanced statistical packages, SQL, Hadoop, and open source tools like Python and Perl. In 2019, our team will deliver a dashboard for software development managers that provides in depth insights and business metrics about their teams, providing historical trending analysis along with comparisons against organizational averages, guiding managers toward improvement opportunities in development agility. By gathering datasets such as deployments, code submissions, code reviews, and team hierarchy, the dashboard will also provide a view for technical leaders to drive crosscutting initiatives such as SDE Ratios, remote code contributions, and migration to native AWS. Success will be measured by providing a dashboard built on Systems Intelligence (our internal data lake) that improves development agility. Examples include quantifying the efficiency gained by migrating to optimized platforms (pre-compute queries and deployment automation) along with identifying teams that could benefit from leveraging these services. Other examples include enabling teams to track increases in deployment velocity, increase in code coverage, and/or reduction in technical debt. With the cost of engineering resources constantly on the rise, leaders must seek opportunities to increase the efficiency of software development. Attempting to quantify software agility and baseline the maturity of software development teams has been a long-standing challenge because of the complexity in the development process and various forms of output. Providing visibility into the outcome of software development enables teams to identify maturity opportunities within their own processes and better understand the impact of changes.

Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities - we're just getting started. We are looking for a Data Science Manager who is passionate about helping us fight the bad guys and protect the FB and IG communities. The Community Integrity team focuses on detecting and mitigating high-intensity experiences ranging from terrorism and child exploitation to hate speech and pornography. We also strive to build legitimacy with the broader community by acting with fairness and transparency. This involves building artificial intelligence to detect violations at scale, as well as tools to maximize the accuracy and efficiency of our reps who review suspected violations so we can achieve optimal outcomes. Community Integrity Focus: Community Integrity's mission is to minimize bad experiences for the over 2.5 billion+ people on FB and IG. Specifically, we are in charge of enforcing Community Standards: a set of policies intended to keep the community safe from violations such as spam, financial scams, hate speech, and bullying. Our job is to quickly detect and remove violating content and abusive accounts, as well as identify ways to minimize future attacks. We are focused on two key metrics: prevalence of bad experiences and false positives. Real world impact on over 2.5 billion+ people – or at least the hundreds of who encounter bad experiences. This role is key to keeping the platform healthy and engaged – if we don’t do this successfully, FB and IG will be riddled with objectionable content and people will disengage or stop coming entirely. Growth organization culture – the team is known for making data-driven decisions with extreme focus. It’s a great place to have an impact. Inflection point – this is a good time to join the team. We have M-team attention. We have cross-functional org alignment and high-level alignment objectives and goals, but are still exploring major strategic shifts and new technology paradigms. Global – tackle problems across the globe. Intellectually challenging – areas such as hate speech are nuanced, require careful consideration of fairness and over-reach. Passionate team – attracts people who care.  Responsibilities   Managing all of Objectionable Content (working to minimize the impact of hate speech, graphic violence, and pornography). Partnering with ML engineers to identify signals and build AI to identify potential violations in these areas and trigger automated responses and/or representative review. Identifying opportunities to improve tools to maximize the accuracy and efficiency of representatives who perform these reviews. Developing measurement to identify the prevalence of these bad experiences, as well as our accuracy enforcing against them. Closely partnering with PM and Engineering – not as a grader for projects, but as a key partner who helps figure out the product strategy and prioritize investment areas. Product and Engineering rely on DS to drive the measurement and then do the analysis and research to understand these spaces and then drive the future courses of action for the platform.  Minimum Qualification  3+ years of experience in managing other team members in a formal or informal capacity. Experience initiating and driving projects to completion with minimal guidance. Experience crisply and clearly communicating the results of analysis to an executive audience.   Preferred Qualification   5+ years of experience doing quantitative analysis at a technology company, consulting, investment banking, or product management, including experience with SQL or other programming languages Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, Math, Physics, Engineering, or related quantitative field Understanding of statistical analysis, experience with packages, such as R, MATLAB, SPSS, SAS, Stata, etc. Experience with large data sets and distributed computing (Hive/Hadoop)  Facebook is proud to be an Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer.

Or that Journée nationale des patriotes in Quebec and Patriots Day in Boston are completely unrelated? But, more importantly, did you ever wonder how transit ridership, app usage, and ticket sales are dependent on your knowledge of these facts? We have so many questions. How is ticketing doing in Cincinnati? What kinds of users are just browsing vs buying? Why do Australian users check the app more often and what does that mean for their other behavior? How much value are we providing our partners? Which markets should we enter next? What is our adoption in Baltimore and how much did our endorsement by the MTA influence it? The discoveries you make and the data-backed stories you tell will directly influence the direction of Transit. What is the next business opportunity we’ll pursue? What first-mile last-mile service just launched but isn’t being discovered? How many users can we expect to use the app next month? Next year?
